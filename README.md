# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification (Deep Neural Network)

A fully-connected Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built with Keras/TensorFlow
to classify **handwritten digits (0-9)** from the MNIST dataset.

---

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features
- **Five hidden layers** (50 neurons each) with ReLU activation
- **Dropout regularization** (20%) to reduce overfitting
- **Adam optimizer** and **categorical crossentropy** loss
- Achieves ~98% accuracy on the MNIST test set

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- **Source:** [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
- 60,000 training images, 10,000 test images
- Each image is 28Ã—28 pixels, grayscale.
